Code outline for basic GA neuroevolution:

Main function:
Takes parameters as inputs (pop size, mutation rates, fitness function? etc)
    Create N new genomes through some randomization
    Give fitness ranking to each in first gen
    For G generations run:
        rank all in current gen by fitness
        Make N-1 new genomes by randomly selecting one of T top parents, then mutating
        Take top 10 individuals from last gen:
            run fitness on each 30 times, take mean for new fitness
            take highest fitness of these, add to new gen
    Print last gen into file?
    return best genome
    
    
Issues to consider:
    Should tensors be float or double? Is there a significant cost to double?
    
    
Params to fiddle with:
